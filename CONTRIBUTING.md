## How to contribute to terraform-provider-cli

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/canadiannomad/terraform-provider-cli/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/canadiannomad/terraform-provider-cli/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, create an example of your usage as a simple tf file, and **paste the content into the issue description**

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the plugin will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Create a fork and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

* Create a PR and we'll review.

Thanks!
